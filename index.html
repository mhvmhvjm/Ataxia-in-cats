    <h1>Ataxia in cats – symptoms and treatment&nbsp;</h1>
    <h3>27 February 2022</h3>
<p>Have you noticed that your cat can't control its feet or suddenly walks like it's drunk? If so, your cat may suffer from ataxia. Ataxia in cats is a more common health problem, especially in domestic cats, and in some cases may require medical intervention for its treatment. Ataxia is one of the most common neurological problems observed in cats. Read on to learn more about the causes, symptoms and treatment of ataxia in cats... </p>
    <p> <a href="#">&nbsp;</a></p>
    <h2><span>What is ataxia in cats?</span></h2>
    <p>&nbsp;Ataxia is a term used to describe the appearance of loss of balance by affecting the head, arms and legs or torso of cats by preventing them from coordinating. Ataxia occurs due to the fact that the sensory functions of the nervous system are reduced and do not fully perform their duties, which can be seen as an extension of a wide variety of diseases. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Ataxia is considered a symptom rather than a disease in itself and occurs as a reflection of various health problems. It occurs as a result of problems that occur especially in the parts of an animal's body that are responsible for its movements. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;There are different types of ataxia, and the distinction between these different forms is based on neurological examination findings and is quite simple. Three main types of ataxia can be seen in cats: </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Vestibular ataxia: The vestibular system is located in the cat's inner ear and brain stem, and its task is to maintain balance, a feeling of up and down. In cats with vestibular ataxia, situations such as tilting of the head, falling and rolling usually occur. These cats often seem overly sleepy or calm.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The problem is usually one-sided, and wherever the cat tilts its head, the problem is seen on that side. Sensory (spinal or proprioceptive) ataxia: Sensory ataxia is a condition that usually occurs due to problems that occur in the spinal cord, especially spinal cord compression. This type of ataxia is also called generalized proprioceptive ataxia. Cats suffering from this problem do not know where their feet are and feel that their feet are in a vacuum. In this case, the cat's toes are knuckled or thrown foot on foot.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Cerebellar ataxia: The part of the cat that controls fine motor movements and strength levels is the cerebellum. In cats with cerebellar ataxia, uncoordinated movements of the limbs, trunk and head occur. Cats plagued by cerebellar ataxia often have an imposing posture and move by taking wide steps. Symptoms such as trembling and shaking in the head or body may also occur. They may also have difficulty jumping. Cerebellar ataxia is one of the syndromes in which clinical manifestations are most easily distinguished and easy to identify.</p>
